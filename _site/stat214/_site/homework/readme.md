# Homework

This is a great place to put your homework! Instructions:

* fork [the repo](https://github.com/mbrudd/site) and clone it 
* create a new branch to work on
* create your own subdirectory of this `homework` directory
* do some work 
* when you're ready to submit your work, create a pull request

We'll discuss this more in class. The [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en) or [the book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) might be useful.
