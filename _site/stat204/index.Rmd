The fundamental objective of this course is to build your statistical competence. 
To that end, we will investigate various examples and data sets, 
keeping the central questions of statistics in mind as we go:

- Are the observed differences just due to chance, or is there a ***real*** difference?
- If there is a real difference, 
    + how big is it? 
    + what caused it? 
    + what does it mean?

Making sense of these questions is one of our goals; another is cultivating a systematic approach 
to data-driven research. After taking this course, you should be able to analyze data for yourself 
to obtain meaningful, defensible insights into whatever interests you.
You must therefore

-   stay caught up with the readings and assignments,
-   work together within the parameters of the Honor Code, and
-   talk to me whenever you have questions.

If you don't understand something, get help immediately!

#### Honor Code

As a Sewanee student, you have already sworn to uphold the Honor Code; I
expect you to comport yourself accordingly. Work with your classmates to
understand the course material, but submit work that is truly your own.
You must not consult with other students when taking exams or quizzes.
In addition to avoiding a guilty conscience, you?ll learn more this way
anyhow!

#### Attendance

Missing class seriously undermines the educational process, so be
responsible and don?t do it unless absolutely necessary.

#### Special needs

Please notify me immediately if you have any documented special needs
that need to be accommodated. The University's ADA statement may be helpful in this regard:
