Write an R script that

  - stores how many dogs your family has in the object `dogs`
  - stores how many cats your family has in the object `cats`
  - stores how many other pets your family has in the object `other`
  - computes how many pets your family has and then removes the `other` object
  - converts the vector produced by `c("17", "21", "34", "45")` into a vector of integers and then into a matrix with 2 rows
