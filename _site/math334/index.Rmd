Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide insight into heat flow,
chemical diffusion, wave propagation, option pricing, random walks,
insect swarming, image processing, crystal growth, differential
geometry, gravity, and lots of other things. PDEs show up all over the place 
because they're usually relevant in problems with more than one independent 
variable, i.e., _most_ problems!

To learn more about these equations and their uses, we will explore several important 
examples, including the holy trinity of PDEs:

-   the wave equation, 
-   the heat equation, and
-   Laplace's equation.

We will discuss methods for solving these equations, we will see how auxiliary conditions 
affect solutions, and we will discuss the qualitative properties of solutions. 

To succeed in this course, you must

-   stay caught up with the readings and assignments,
-   work together within the parameters of the Honor Code, and
-   talk to me whenever you have questions.

***If you don't understand something, get help immediately!***

#### Textbook

-   _Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers_ by Stanley J. Farlow

#### Times & locations

-   MWF, 1:00-1:50 p.m., Woods Labs 119

#### Office hours & contact info.

I should have time to talk right after our class meets MWF, and I should be available on Tuesdays 
and Thursdays from 1:30 to 2:30. You are also welcome to drop by whenever my office door is open; please talk 
to me if you would like to arrange a specific time to meet. My office is Woods Labs 127A, my office phone 
number is 1820, and my email address is `mbrudd@sewanee.edu`. Remember, though, that it's usually better 
to talk _in person_ than to communicate indirectly!

#### Grading

To help you stay caught up with the material and practice for exams,
there will be regularly assigned homework. There will be three exams, two during
the term and a comprehensive final exam at ***2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, December 18^th^***. 
Your scores on these components will contribute to your final grade as follows:

-   Exams (2): 20% each
-   Homework: 40%
-   Final exam: 20%

If you cannot avoid turning in an assignment late or missing an exam for
a ***legitimate*** reason (e.g., being out of town to participate in a
University-related activity), you must talk to me ahead of time to reschedule things. 
***Otherwise, make-up exams will not be given and late work will not be accepted.***

#### Honor Code

As a Sewanee student, you have already sworn to uphold the Honor Code; I
expect you to comport yourself accordingly. Work with your classmates to
understand the course material, but submit work that is truly your own.
You must not consult with other students when taking exams or quizzes.
In addition to avoiding a guilty conscience, you'll learn more this way
anyhow!

#### Attendance

Missing class seriously undermines the educational process, so be
responsible and don't do it unless absolutely necessary.

#### Special needs

Please notify me immediately if you have any documented special needs
that need to be accommodated. The University's ADA statement may be helpful in this regard:

_The University of the South is committed to fostering respect for the diversity of the University community and the individual rights of each member of that community. In this spirit, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the University seeks to provide students with disabilities with the reasonable accommodations needed to ensure equal access to the programs and activities of the University. Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments is requested to speak with Student Accessibility Services and the instructor, as early in the semester as possible. If you have already requested accommodations, it is your responsibility to present your instructor with a copy of your academic accommodations letter from Student Accessibility Services which is located in the University Wellness Center (931.598.1270). Accommodations will not be provided without this documentation, and accommodations cannot be applied retroactively. Additional information about disability accommodations can be found online at http://sewanee.edu/student-life/university-wellness-center/ ._
