#### Textbook 

- _Topology_, 2nd edition, by James R. Munkres 


#### Times & location

-   TuTh, 1:30 p.m.-2:45 p.m. CST, Woods Labs 123 

#### Homework, exams, and grading

To help you learn the material, gain experience communicating mathematics, and practice for exams, 
homework problems will be assigned regularly and discussed on Thursdays. ***Students will workshop their 
solutions to the homework problems on Thursdays and will type up solutions every week in $\LaTeX$;*** we'll discuss 
procedural details in class. There will be 2 exams, and your scores on these components will contribute 
to your final grade as follows:

-   Homework presentations and write-ups: 50%
-   Exams (2): 25% each

#### Honor Code

As a Sewanee student, you have already sworn to uphold the Honor Code; I
expect you to comport yourself accordingly. Work with your classmates to
understand the course material, but submit work that is truly your own.
You must not consult with other students when taking exams.
In addition to avoiding a guilty conscience, you'll learn more this way
anyhow!

#### Attendance

Missing class seriously undermines the educational process, so be
responsible and don't do it unless absolutely necessary.

#### Special needs

Please notify me immediately if you have any documented special needs
that need to be accommodated. The University's ADA statement may be helpful in this regard:
