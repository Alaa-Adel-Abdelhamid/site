#### Textbook 

-   _Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems_ by Boyce and DiPrima 


#### Times & location

-   TuTh, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. CST, online

#### Grading

To help you stay caught up with the material and practice for exams, homework will be assigned regularly 
and discussed at the beginning of each class; ***students will be responsible for leading the 
discussion of homework problems***. There will be 2 exams, and your scores on these components will contribute 
to your final grade as follows:

-   Homework: 25%
-   Exams (2): 25% each
-   Best of these: 25%

#### Honor Code

As a Sewanee student, you have already sworn to uphold the Honor Code; I
expect you to comport yourself accordingly. Work with your classmates to
understand the course material, but submit work that is truly your own.
You must not consult with other students when taking exams or quizzes.
In addition to avoiding a guilty conscience, you'll learn more this way
anyhow!

#### Attendance

Missing class seriously undermines the educational process, so be
responsible and don't do it unless absolutely necessary.

#### Special needs

Please notify me immediately if you have any documented special needs
that need to be accommodated. The University's ADA statement may be helpful in this regard:

_The University of the South is committed to fostering respect for the diversity of the University community and the individual rights of each member of that community. In this spirit, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the University seeks to provide students with disabilities with the reasonable accommodations needed to ensure equal access to the programs and activities of the University. Any student with a documented disability needing academic adjustments is requested to speak with Student Accessibility Services and the instructor, as early in the semester as possible. If you have already requested accommodations, it is your responsibility to present your instructor with a copy of your academic accommodations letter from Student Accessibility Services which is located in the University Wellness Center (931.598.1270).
