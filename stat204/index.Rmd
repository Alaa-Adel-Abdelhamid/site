The fundamental objective of this course is to build your statistical competence. 
To that end, we will investigate a variety of research problems, 
keeping the central questions of statistics in mind as we go:

- Are the observed differences just due to chance, or is there a ***real*** difference?
- If there is a real difference, 
    + how big is it? 
    + what caused it? 
    + what does it mean?

Making sense of these questions is one of our tasks; another is 
cultivating a systematic approach to data-driven research. After taking 
this course, you should be able to apply a step-by-step process of
problem identification, data collection, and data analysis to obtain
meaningful, defensible insights into your own research questions.
You must therefore

-   stay caught up with the readings and assignments,
-   work together within the parameters of the Honor Code, and
-   talk to me whenever you have questions.

If you don't understand something, get help immediately!

#### Textbook 

-   [*Introduction to Statistical Investigations*](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/) by
    Tintle et al. (4th edition)

#### Times & location

-   Section D: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30-10:45 p.m., Woods Labs 134
-   Section E: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:00-12:15 p.m., Woods Labs 134

#### Office hours & contact info.

Drop by whenever my office door is open, or talk to me to arrange a
specific time to meet. My office is Woods Labs 127A, my email
address is mbrudd (at) sewanee.edu, and my office phone number is 1820.
Remember, though, that it's usually better to talk ***in person*** than to
communicate by email or phone!

#### Grading

To help you stay caught up with the material and practice for exams,
there will be frequent quizzes and homework. There will be three exams, two 
during the semester and a [comprehensive final exam](http://registrar.sewanee.edu/schedule/college-of-arts-and-sciences-examinations/). 
Your scores on these components will contribute to your final
grade as follows:

-   In-class exams (2): 20% each
-   Quizzes & homework: 20%
-   Final exam: 20%
-   Best of these: 20%

If you cannot avoid missing a quiz or exam for a ***legitimate*** reason
(e.g., being out of town to participate in a University-related
activity), you must talk to me ***ahead of time*** to get permission to
submit your work late. ***Otherwise, make-up quizzes/exams will not be
given.***

#### Honor Code

As a Sewanee student, you have already sworn to uphold the Honor Code; I
expect you to comport yourself accordingly. Work with your classmates to
understand the course material, but submit work that is truly your own.
You must not consult with other students when taking exams or quizzes.
In addition to avoiding a guilty conscience, you?ll learn more this way
anyhow!

#### Attendance

Missing class seriously undermines the educational process, so be
responsible and don?t do it unless absolutely necessary.

#### Special needs

Please notify me immediately if you have any documented special needs
that need to be accommodated.
