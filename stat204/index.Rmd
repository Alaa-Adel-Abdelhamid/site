<br>

We are constantly bombarded by data and by claims _about_ data -- it has never been more important
to be able to distinguish between the sensible claims and the preposterous ones. Data literacy 
and statistical competence are therefore essential skills, and this course aims to help you develop them.
Instead of working with contrived datasets, we'll tackle some messy real-world data head on, and you'll
learn the tools you need to answer realistic questions. These skills will help you in future courses, in your 
jobs, and in your lives as citizens of a complicated world. After taking this course, you should be able to 
analyze data for yourself to obtain meaningful insights and to make decisions that you can defend. 

We will work through chapters 1 through 9 of the book, devoting 3 classes to each chapter: I will mostly lecture for 
the first class, you will present your homework and we'll discuss the remaining topics in the second class, then you 
will work in pairs on a mini-project in the third class. To get the most out of this experience and contribute your 
share, you must

- stay caught up with the readings and assignments,
- work together within the parameters of the Honor Code, and
- talk to me whenever you have questions.

If you don't understand something, get help immediately!

#### Homework, exams, and grading

To help all of you develop your data analysis skills, practice communicating technical results, and practice for exams, 
you will present your work regularly and pair up with other students on in-class mini-projects. There will also be 2 exams, 
and your scores on these components will contribute to your final grade as follows:

- Homework: 25%
- In-class projects: 25%
- Exams (2): 25% each

#### Honor Code

As a Sewanee student, you have already sworn to uphold the Honor Code; I
expect you to comport yourself accordingly. Work with your classmates to
understand the course material, but submit work that is truly your own.
You must not consult with other students when taking exams or quizzes.
In addition to avoiding a guilty conscience, you'll learn more this way
anyhow!

#### Attendance

Missing class seriously undermines the educational process, so be
responsible and don't do it unless absolutely necessary.

#### Special needs

Please notify me immediately if you have any documented special needs
that need to be accommodated. The University's ADA statement may be helpful in this regard:
